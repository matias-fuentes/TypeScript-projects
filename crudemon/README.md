## Sidenotes

- Now with the new version of Crudemon with the new JavaScript superset that I've learned; TypeScript, the types and confidentiality when pushing is stronger than ever.
- Also, I fixed the READ unit test error which stopped the execution for an error that I was accidentally throwing.

## Features

- NEW! Redux implementation!
- Responsive design.
- CRUD completed and functional.
- Refactored code and smart and an exhaustive use of the reuse capability through the React components.
- Capacity to manage your own Pokémons.
- Proper page integration with the REST API and its respective endpoints.
- TDD End to End testing.
- Full of good practices and its key factor: passion.

P.D.: I made a video presenting the project! I strongly recommend to you to watch it (keep in mind that it's in Spanish). Above of this same README, in the links section, you'll find a direct link if you want to watch it :).
